# Semantic Segmentation
## Background

The dataset provides high-quality, densely annotated video sequences for various computer
vision tasks. In this hackathon, participants will work with video object segmentation, object
detection, and object tracking using the dataset.
Semantic segmentation, involves classifying every pixel in an image, finds practical applications
across various domains.

## Practical Applications 

1. Medical Diagnostics: It aids in detecting abnormalities such as tumors, malignant cells,
etc in X-rays, CT scans, and MRI images.
2. GeoSensing: Used for land usage mapping from satellite imagery, monitoring
deforestation, and urbanization.
3. Autonomous Vehicles: Enables self-driving cars to understand their environment, identify
lane lines, and recognize traffic signs.
4. Retail Image Analysis: Helps businesses analyze product placement on shelves.
